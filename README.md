# Nano Vision

How to Use:
- Ensure that your project's run directory is in the project directory (or, any directory with a valid `settings.txt` 
  like the one included in this project)
- Edit `settings.txt` to change settings such as the camera focal length (fx/fy) and focal center (cx/cy)
- When testing, it may also help to enable `gui=true` and `gui.field=true` to open a window which shows scanned AprilTags as well as the estimated field position of the camera.
